## 🎤 How to Demo in Interviews

### 2-Minute Demo Script:

**Opening (20 seconds):**
"I built an interactive dashboard that analyzes 14 years of Iranian currency data to 
identify crisis periods and their correlation with geopolitical events."

**Technical (40 seconds):**
"I processed over 3,600 trading days using Python and SQL, engineered 7 risk metrics 
including volatility and drawdown, and implemented a statistical crisis detection 
algorithm. I integrated the GDELT news API to correlate events with market movements."

**Results (30 seconds):**
"The analysis identified 372 crisis days with -15% average returns compared to -0.03% 
on normal days - that's 500x worse performance. Crisis days show 6x higher volatility."

**Impact (30 seconds):**
"This provides actionable insights for risk management, helping businesses time their 
currency transactions and hedge during high-volatility periods. The dashboard is 
deployed online using Streamlit Cloud with interactive filtering and visualization."
