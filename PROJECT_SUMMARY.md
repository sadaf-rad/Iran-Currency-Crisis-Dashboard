## 🗣️ Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"I built an interactive financial analytics dashboard that analyzes 14 years of Iranian
currency data to identify crisis periods. Using Python and SQL, I processed over 3,600
trading days and identified 372 crisis events with extreme volatility. The dashboard
integrates news data via API to show how geopolitical events impact currency markets.
It's deployed online using Streamlit and demonstrates my skills in data engineering,
statistical analysis, and visualization. This project shows I can take raw data and
turn it into actionable business insights."
